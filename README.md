# Get twitter thread

Built for the simple purpose of retrieving a thread. I use it for storing information in a personal knowledge base.

Why? You might ask.

Because the Twitter v2 API does not make it easy. So I made this so that it is 😁

## Usage

### 1. Setup developer account and get API credentials

Follow [Getting started instructions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api) on the Twitter Developer platform.

### 2. Instantiate client

Authenticate as described in [API SDK](https://github.com/PLhery/node-twitter-api-v2/blob/master/doc/auth.md)

Note: I've only used the "Application-only authentication flow"

### 3. Use `TwitterThread`
